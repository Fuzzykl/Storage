Add-Ons	
Add-Ons are a content type available in the Minecraft Marketplace that lets you add custom blocks, items, mobs, recipes and other game content to your world.	
Add-Ons allow you to modify your existing worlds and Realms through the Edit World screen and the Create New World screen.	
Stacking Add-Ons	
Stacking, or adding multiple Add-Ons, can increase loading times and could result in unexpected results.	
We recommend that you save a copy of your world or Realm before adding or removing Add-Ons. 	
For more information about how you can make the most out of Add-Ons, you can visit our FAQ page.	
Add-On FAQs	
Adventure Mode	
Adventure Mode is a gamemode for world builders. In Adventure Mode, players must use special tools to place or break blocks.	
To get these special tools, you must use §e/give§f with §ecanplace§f or §ecandestroy§f parameters while in creative mode.	
Anvil	
Experience Levels can be used to repair, enchant, or rename items with the Anvil.	
Renaming and Applying Enchantments	
All items can be renamed, although only items with durability can be repaired or enchanted with Books on the Anvil.	
Repairing	
An item can be repaired by placing it in one of the input slots on the left, along with either some raw materials of the item, like Iron Ingots for an Iron Sword, or combined with another item of the same type.	
Combining items is more efficient when done with an Anvil.	
There is a chance that the Anvil will be damaged with each use and after enough usage it will be destroyed.	
Armour	
By wearing Armour, you can protect yourself from incoming damage. Your Armour level is represented by :armor: on the HUD, the higher the level, the less damage you will take.	
Crafting	
Armour can be crafted from Leather, Iron, Gold or Diamond. Chainmail Armour can be obtained through villager trading and loot from zombies and skeletons.	
Equip Armour by opening your inventory and moving pieces of Armour to the appropriate slot next to your player skin.	
Iron, Chain, and Gold Armour can be smelted into Iron or Gold Nuggets in a Furnace.	
Shield	
The Shield will block incoming damage. The Shield can be equipped in the offhand slot as well as the hotbar. Press and hold :_input_key.sneak: to block with the Shield.	
The Shield will block incoming damage. The Shield can be equipped in the offhand slot as well as the hotbar. Press :_input_key.sneak: or press :_gamepad_stick_right: to toggle block with the Shield.	
The Shield blocks all kinds of incoming damage – even a Creeper explosion! It can be equipped in the offhand slot or the hotbar.	
When using the 'D-Pad & tap to interact' control scheme, tap :touch_sneak: to toggle blocking with the shield.	
When using a 'Joystick' control scheme, tap :tip_virtual_button_sneak: to toggle blocking with the shield.	
The Shield will block incoming damage. The Shield can be equipped in the offhand slot as well as the hotbar. Press :_input_key.sneak: or click :rift_X: to toggle block with the Shield.	
The Shield will block incoming damage. The Shield can be equipped in the offhand slot as well as the hotbar. Press :_input_key.sneak: or click :windowsmr_right_stick: to toggle block with the Shield.	
The Shield can even block a Creeper explosion!	
Disguise	
You can also wear a Carved Pumpkin on your head. This won't give you any :armour: but will make it so Endermen won't get angry when you look at them.	
Armour Stand	
An Armour Stand holds your armour while you aren't using it.	
Outfitting	
Press :_input_key.use: on an Armour Stand while holding a piece of armour to place it on the Armour Stand.	
Tap an Armour Stand while holding a piece of armour to place it on the Armour Stand.	
Press :_input_key.use: on an Armour Stand with an open hand to remove something from the Armour Stand.	
Tap an Armour Stand with an open hand to remove something from the Armour Stand.	
Posing	
An Armour Stand can change its pose, sneak and press :_input_key.use: on an Armor Stand to change the pose.	
An Armour Stand can change its pose, sneak and tap an Armour Stand to change the pose.	
Dancing	
Armour Stands will react to a Redstone signal, try giving it different signal strengths and see what happens.	
Banners	
Banners are a cool way to decorate your house or castle with custom patterns and colours.	
After crafting a Banner, you can put it on a Crafting Table or Loom and add different dyes to create your own unique, cool design!	
Applying a Pattern	
There are many different patterns that you can create with your dye such as:	
  - Making a triangle will give you a chevron pattern.	
  - Making a cross gives you a cross pattern.	
  - Adding a Oxeye Daisy gives you a flower pattern.	
Experiment with different combinations to get even more patterns!	
Multiple Layers	
A Banner can also have multiple layers, allowing you to have more than one pattern on your Banner. If you don't like the last pattern you put on a Banner, you can wash the last layer off in a Cauldron.	
Making Copies	
If you want to copy a Banner, put it on the Crafting Table with a blank Banner.	
Beacons	
Active Beacons project a bright beam of light into the sky.	
They are crafted with Glass, Obsidian, and Nether Stars (which is obtained by defeating the Wither).	
Construction	
Beacons need to be on top of a Pyramid of Iron, Gold, Emerald, Diamond or Netherite blocks with an unobstructed view of the sky.	
The material that the Beacon is placed on has no effect on the power of the Beacon.	
Use	
In the Beacon menu you can select one primary power for your Beacon. The more tiers your pyramid has the more powers you can have.	
To set the powers of your Beacon you must use a Netherite Ingot, Emerald, Diamond, Gold Ingot or Iron Ingot in the payment slot.	
Once set, the powers will emanate from the Beacon indefinitely. Powers are granted to all nearby players.	
To change the colour of the beam, place a stained glass block in its path.	
Beds	
Sleeping in a Bed passes the night and sets your spawn point.	
Press :_input_key.use: on a Bed to go to sleep. This can only be done at night.	
Tap a Bed to go to sleep. This can only be done at night.	
If you are playing Multiplayer, everyone in the world must be in a Bed at the same time to pass the night.	
If your Bed is broken you will return to where you first spawned into the world.	
Be careful when using a Bed in the Nether, it's usually too hot to sleep.	
Beds	
How to Play: Beds	
A soft bed lets you sleep through the night. You'll need wool to craft one, as well as a safe spot to place it.	
Sleeping in a bed will also set your §espawn point§f, meaning that if you die, you'll reappear right back home!	
You can only fall asleep when it's cosy, like when it's nighttime or during a thunderstorm.	
Blocks	
The world of Minecraft is made from millions of blocks. Each one is breakable, collectable, and placeable. There are almost no limits to what you can build!	
Most blocks you will have to find in the world, but some can only be crafted such as combining other blocks on a crafting table like a Redstone Block or smelted in a furnace like Glass.	
Falling Blocks	
Most blocks are not affected by gravity and can float in mid air, but some like Sand and Gravel, will fall if there is no block underneath them.	
Interesting Blocks	
Here are some examples of the more interesting blocks in Minecraft:	
§eGlass§f - This is a transparent block that is made by smelting Sand in a Furnace.	
§eConcrete§f – This is made by dropping a Concrete Powder block into water.	
§eTerracotta§f – This is found naturally in Badlands biomes or can be crafted and dyed from Clay that is found underwater. Terracotta can be made into Glazed Terracotta by smelting it in a Furnace.	
§eMagma Block§f – This is found naturally in the Nether, it gives off a little light and will burn whoever steps on it.

§eRepeat§f – Once activated, this Command Block will continue executing its stored command as long as it exists.	
§eCondition§f – There are two conditions, each will affect the behaviour of the Command Block:	
§eUnconditional§f – Executes the stored command even if the Command Block behind it failed to execute its command.	
§eConditional§f – Only executes the stored command if the Command Block behind it succeeded in executing its command.	
§eRedstone§f – There are two redstone settings, each will affect the behaviour of the Command Block:	
§eNeeds Redstone§f – Requires a redstone signal to activate.	
§eAlways Active§f – Does not require a redstone signal to activate.

Death and Respawn	
How to Play: Death and Respawn	
Enemies appear every night and even the best of us can be caught off guard. If your §ehealth bar§f:heart: runs out, you'll die – and then respawn right where you started!	
You have unlimited lives, but you drop all items in your inventory when you die. If you're quick enough, you can pick your items back up right where you dropped them.	
Difficulty	
Minecraft has varying levels of difficulty so you can tailor the game to your level.	
Peaceful	
No hostile mobs will spawn except for shulkers and the Ender Dragon, but they won't do any damage to you.	
Easy	
Hostile mobs spawn but deal less damage. Hunger bar depletes and drains health down to 5 hearts.	
Normal	
Hostile mobs will do normal damage, and if your hunger level drops to zero your health will begin to drop, but you won't die.	
Hard	
Hostile mobs will do more damage, zombies will break through doors, and if your hunger level drops to zero, your health will drop and you could die.

Dyes	
Dye is used to change the colour of many things in Minecraft.

§eBlue Dye§f - Mining Lapis Lazuli deep underground	
§eBlack Dye§f – Collecting Ink Sacs from Squids

You can steer while gliding by looking around. If you look downwards, you'll gain some speed, but you'll also hit the ground faster. If you look upwards, you'll gain some height, but do it for too long and you'll stall – which means you'll start falling.	
Your Elytra will slowly lose durability while flying and if they break mid-flight, you'll fall. You can repair them by combining them with Phantom Membrane at an Anvil.	
Rocket Powered Flight	
Firework Rockets that have no effects can be used to extend Elytra flight. You will be damaged if you use a Firework Rocket that has effects to extend flight.

Eye Of Ender	
Eyes of Ender are mysteriously connected to the End and will behave strangely when used.	
Rumour has it that they can lead you to open another dimension.	
Farming	
There are a variety of different crops that you can farm in Minecraft. Farming, while challenging, can provide an infinite food source.	
Plan Ahead	
Crops require light, water, and farmland to grow. You need a hoe, a water source, and seeds to farm.	
The Blocks next to the water need to be converted to farmland, do this with the hoe. Water will saturate up to four block away.	
Planting and Harvesting	
Now you can plant your seeds. Make sure your crops are protected as they can easily die from being trampled or lack of water or light.

Some raw metals will need to be smelted using a §efurnace§f:furnace: . Place a fuel like coal or wood logs in the fuel slot, then add raw ore to smelt it into something useful.	
Mounts	
A player can ride any adult §eHorse§f, §eDonkey§f, §eMule§f or §eCamel§f. Only Horses can be armoured.	
Mules and Donkeys may be equipped with saddlebags (for transporting items) by attaching a Chest. These saddlebags can then be accessed whilst riding or sneaking.	
Taming	
Horses, Donkeys and Mules must be §etamed§f before they can be used. A player can tame a horse by riding it and staying on while it tries to buck them off. Press :_input_key.use: with an empty hand to attempt to tame Horses, Donkeys and Mules.	
Horses, Donkeys and Mules must be §etamed§f before they can be used. A player can tame a horse by riding it and staying on while it tries to buck them off. Tap the Mount button that appears when near a horse to attempt to tame Horses, Donkeys and Mules.	
When Hearts appear around the horse, it has been tamed and will no longer attempt to throw the player off.	
Riding Animals	
To steer horses and camels, the player must equip them with a §eSaddle§f. 	
Saddles can be bought from villagers, found inside Chests hidden in the world or acquired by fishing. While riding a horse, open your inventory and put a saddle in the horse's saddle slot.	
A camel can carry two players at the same time.	
Horses and Donkeys can be bred like other animals using Golden Apples or Golden Carrots.	
Foals will grow into adult horses over time, although feeding them Wheat or Hay will speed this up.	
Pack Animals	
Llamas are another ridable mob which can be tamed and used to transport large shipments of items. 	
Llamas can be tamed the same as horses. However, even when tamed, the player can't control their movements when riding them. 	
A lead can be attached to one, and when this happens, surrounding llamas (both tamed and un-tamed) will follow, making a caravan. 	
Llamas can be equipped with chests, giving it 3-15 slots of inventory space depending on the strength of the Llama. They can also be equipped with carpets. Each carpet colour yields a different pattern.	
Pigs	
Pigs can be ridden as well, although they won't go where you want without a little incentive. 	
Equip a pig with a Saddle and point a Carrot on a Stick in the direction you want to go.

Navigation	
Navigation is an important skill that you will learn in Minecraft as it's not always easy to find your way home.	
First of all, there are some basic tools that you should know about.	
Navigation Tools	
A Compass will point in the direction of the first place you spawned into the world, an easy way to find where you started.	
A Map lets you see the area you've explored. Put it in your offhand slot to use it like a mini-map. You can increase its size by adding more paper to the edges in a Crafting Table.	
A Locator Map will show you where you are and what direction you are facing in relation to the Locator Map's origin. It will also show you the location of other players in the same world.	
A Cartography Table can help you create, expand, copy and even name maps.	
Place paper into the first slot to craft a Map. If you add a compass into the second slot you can craft a Locator Map. Adding Paper or a blank Map will let you expand or copy your Map.	
Navigation Techniques	
Try to watch for landmarks as you explore. The more you play on a world, the more you will be able to remember where you are. Another good trick is to place Torches as you go so that you may find your way back home.	
The sun can also tell you what direction you are facing. Remember: the sun rises in the east and sets in the west!	
Explorer Maps	
There are several places for you to explore. Find a village and look for a Cartographer. He will trade you Explorer Maps that will lead you to strange places very far away.	
Nether Portal	
A Nether Portal allows you to travel to a different dimension.	
If constructed correctly the Nether Portal can be lit and activated.	
Example of a portal construction shown here:	
Nightfall	
In Minecraft, the sun rises and sets as you adventure in your world. As the sun sets, you must take precautions. There are many dangers at night!	
Take Shelter	
If you have not already, you will need a place to take shelter from the dark and what lurks within it. This can be as simple as a hole in the side of a hill or a small cabin in the forest.	
Be sure to block off all entrances, you may want to use a door so you can go in and out. If you have made a bed this is a good place to put it along with your Crafting Table and Furnace.	
Also be sure to light up the area with torches, it may save your life.	
Nightfall	
How to Play: Nightfall	
When the sun starts to set, it's time to get ready.	
At night, the Overworld is home to zombies, spiders, skeletons and other dangerous creatures we call §ehostile mobs§f.	
Crafting some §etorches§f can help you see in the dark, while also keeping mobs from spawning too close.	
While holding a torch, place it into the world by right-clicking a nearby free surface.	
While holding a torch, place it into the world by pressing :_input_key.use:.

Cats	
Cats are a neutral mob that can be found in villages. They will attack Rabbits and Baby Turtles. They will also keep Phantoms and Creepers away. They will try to run from you so taming them can be tough. They like fish, so give them Raw Cod or Salmon to tame them.	
Parrots	
Parrots are a passive mob that live in the Jungle. They will imitate any other mob in the area. Seeds are their favourite, give them a few to tame them. Parrots will also sit on your shoulder... Yes, you can have more than one up there.	
Raids	
While exploring the world you may encounter a Pillager encampment or patrol. Pillagers are always looking for villages to raid. Taking their Banners will get their attention, and they may choose to attack a nearby village.	
Be sure to defend your village, the attack will stop if you defeat all the raiders.	
I Need A Hero	
Villagers will probably be very grateful that you have saved them from the raiders. Be sure to check back with them, you might get a good deal.	
Ranching	
In Minecraft, you can have your own ranch filled with livestock! Ranching provides lots of resources such as wool, eggs, and raw meat.	
Growing Your Herd	
In order to keep your livestock growing, you have to make baby animals. Adult animals must enter Love Mode for this to happen. Feed the animals their preferred food to get them to enter Love Mode.	
When two like animals are nearby and in Love Mode, they will kiss for a moment and then a baby animal will appear! The baby animal will stay with their parents until they grow into an adult. After having a baby, adult animals must wait 5 minutes before entering Love Mode.	
What Do Mobs Eat?	
Cows, mooshrooms and sheep all eat Wheat. Pigs can eat Carrots or Beetroot. Chickens love Seeds of any kinds. Rabbits will eat Carrots, Golden Carrots or Dandelions. Ocelots enjoy Raw Cod or Salmon. Wolves like to eat any kind of meat.	
Animals will follow you when you hold their desired food item. This will help you lead them to your ranch or another animal.

Redstone	
Redstone Dust comes from Redstone that transmits an electrical signal. When it has power it lights up and transmits its signal to other Redstone items that are next to it.	
Redstone Power	
In order for one of these items to be powered, it needs a power source such as a Lever, Button or Pressure Plate. Experiment to find them all!	
Place some Redstone Dust next to a power source and turn it on to power it.	
There are many items that use a Redstone signal to do something, such as a Hopper or a Piston.	
Redstone allows for endless possibilities! Try creating something useful for yourself like an automatic farm!

Textures	
Texture packs visually transform the game's appearance, applying a fresh coat of paint to your Minecraft world.

Villager Trading	
Trading can be done in villages. Each villager has a profession; they can be Farmers, Butchers, Blacksmiths, Cartographers, Librarians or Priests. Some professions will trade for items that other professions cannot. Explore and trade with many villagers to find all the trades. 	
Goods for Emeralds	
You can find out what a villager is offering as trade by interacting with them. A villager may adjust the price of a trade whenever a player trades with it. A villager may run out of stock, temporarily disabling the trade if it is used too frequently. Trades usually involve buying or selling items for emeralds. 	
As you trade with villagers, they will get better at their profession and start to offer better and more valuable trades.	
Take care of your villagers, they need to rest, work and eat to thrive.

Want to get the most out of your equipment? You'll need a Smithing Table.	
Use it to make all kinds of changes, for example, by upgrading Diamond equipment to Netherite or by making cosmetic changes with Armour Trims.	
In order to upgrade your equipment, you'll need a Smithing Template. You can find a large variety throughout the world, which can be used for all kinds of upgrades.	
Place a Template into the leftmost slot of a Smithing Table to see which items you need for the upgrade.	
For example, to upgrade Diamond equipment to Netherite, you need a Netherite Upgrade Smithing Template, which you can find in Bastion Remnants. Then, place the Diamond equipment in the equipment slot and a Netherite ingot in the ingredient slot and you're done!	
Item properties such as enchantments and armour trims will be retained, but the Smithing Template will be consumed when you upgrade your equipment. Don't worry – you can craft copies of them with your Crafting Table.	
Get creative and customise the look of your armour with Armour Trims. You'll need an Armour Trim Smithing Template to get started, which you can find throughout the world.	
Place a Template into the leftmost slot of a Smithing Table to see which items you need for the upgrade. Then place a piece of armour in the equipment slot and a crystal or ingot in the ingredient slot. Done!	
Only certain crystals and ingots can be used for Armour Trims. Try different kinds like Iron, Gold or Lapis to create unique designs!

What is Realms Plus?	
Realms Plus is a subscription to a personal server supporting up to 10 simultaneous players, along with unlimited access to 150+ great Minecraft worlds, texture packs, skin packs and mash-ups for one low monthly price.	
What is a personal server?	
A personal server allows you to create a shared world that is always online and accessible from any device with Minecraft Marketplace. Players that you invite to your Realm can play this world at any time.	
Do my friends need to purchase Realms Plus to play on my Realm?	
Your friends don't need to purchase a Realms Plus subscription to play on your Realm. You can invite any friend (who has their multiplayer permissions enabled) to join your Realm for free.

How much does a Realms Plus subscription cost?

How long do I have access to Packs within Realms Plus?

Where can I use Realms Plus packs?

If your subscription ends, you and your friends will no longer be able to play online together on Realms, and you will no longer have access to Realms Plus packs. You can download any world saved to your Realm (within 18 months of ending your subscription). If you used Realms Plus worlds, texture packs or mash-ups, you will need to purchase those packs in the store or, if those packs are still in Realms Plus, re-subscribe, to play those world templates.
